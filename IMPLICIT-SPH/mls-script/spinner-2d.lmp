# set parameters that need to be defined before atoms are created or read-in from a file.
# e.g., units, dimension, newton, processors, boundary, atom_style, atom_modify.

# 2) Atom definition
# ------------------
# 1. There are 3 ways to define atoms in LAMMPS. 
# - read them in from a data or 
# - restart file via the read_data or 
# - read_restart commands. 
# These files can contain molecular topology information. 
#
# Or create atoms on a lattice (with no molecular topology). 
# e.g., lattice, region, create_box, create_atoms. 
# The entire set of atoms can be duplicated to make a larger simulation using the replicate command. 

read_data          spinner-2d.data 


# to push out backup file, uncomment restart command for every N (=1000) time iteration
# restart            1000 spinner-2d.*.restart

# uncomment the following command and comment read_data
# from the restarting file
# read_restart       spinner-2d.*.restart


# 3) Settings
# -----------
# Once atoms and molecular topology are defined, a variety of settings can be specified: 
# force field coefficients, simulation parameters, output options, etc.
#
# Force field coefficients are set by these commands (they can also be set in the read-in files): 
# pair_coeff, bond_coeff, angle_coeff, dihedral_coeff, improper_coeff, kspace_style, 
# dielectric, special_bonds.
#
# Various simulation parameters are set by these commands: 
# neighbor, neigh_modify, group, timestep, reset_timestep, run_style, min_style, min_modify.
#
# Fixes impose a variety of boundary conditions, time integration, and diagnostic options. 
# The fix command comes in many flavors.
#
# Various computations can be specified for execution during a simulation using the compute, 
# compute_modify, and variable commands.
#
# Output options are set by the thermo, dump, and restart commands.

# 4) Run a simulation
# -------------------
# A molecular dynamics simulation is run using the run command. 
# Energy minimization (molecular statics) is performed using the minimize command. 
# A parallel tempering (replica-exchange) simulation can be run using the temper command.
