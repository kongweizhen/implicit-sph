Type: Open Source Software

The Department of Energy (DOE), by memo dated 11/9/2016, has granted 
Sandia permission to assert its copyright in software entitled 
" Implicit SPH (ISPH) v. 1.0 ".

In accordance with the DOE's permission:
All copies of "Implicit SPH (ISPH) v. 1.0" that are released under 
an Open Source Software (OSS) license should be marked:

“Copyright (year first published) Sandia Corporation. Under the terms
of Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 with Sandia Corporation, the U.S. 
Government retains certain rights in this software.”

The above notice should appear before the OSS license, and the above 
notice and the OSS license are the ONLY terms that should appear in
the software or the associated web site. No other disclaimers or 
notices should be used.
________________________________________
The primary vehicle for distribution of "Implicit SPH (ISPH) v. 1.0" 
should be the OSS license and associated web site. However, if  
"Implicit SPH (ISPH) v. 1.0" is to be released under a different 
(non-OSS) type of license it should be marked:

“Copyright (year first published) Sandia Corporation. Under the 
terms of Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000, there is a non-exclusive 
license for use of this work by or on behalf of the U.S. Government. 
Export of this program may require a license from the United 
States Government.”

At a minimum, this copyright notice should be on the package 
containing the program. Preferably, the copyright notice 
should also be incorporated into the source code and be displayed 
on at least the first screen that comes up when the software 
is run. In addition, the following complete language should 
also be included in the copyright notice:

                                                 NOTICE:
